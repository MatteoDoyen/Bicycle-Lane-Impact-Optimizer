- instead of allocating a dist array of nb_vertex size, create a linked list who is limited to the vertex within the visibility
- create an error struct and send an error code for each function
- manage memory allocation errors
- improve the line size needed for the fgets function
- instead of creating a csv matrix and reading it, just create the paths all at once
- compute the djikstra_back at the same time than the front
- if the last optimized edge if not in the visibility of the paths, then don't recompute the djikstra
    - implies that djikstras back and front are stored for each paths
- mutualize the thread and non threaded function common code into a single function
