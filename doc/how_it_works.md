# Operational Methodology

The Bicycle Lane Impact Optimizer employs a sophisticated approach to identify the most impactful roads for the implementation of bicycle lanes within urban environments. The methodology is structured around two primary components: a comprehensive representation of urban road networks and cyclist preferences. Here’s how it functions:

## Data Inputs

The solution requires two critical inputs to perform its analysis:

- **Urban Road Network Graph**: A detailed graph that encapsulates the entirety of urban roads and their interconnections, serving as the backbone for optimization analysis.
- **Cyclist Path Preferences**: A curated list detailing the routes frequently traversed by cyclists, highlighting the real-world usage patterns within the urban matrix.

## Optimization Process

The core of the solution lies in its ability to simulate the enhancement of specific roads and quantitatively assess the impact of such improvements. The process unfolds as follows:

1. **Road Improvement Simulation**: Upon selecting a road for potential improvement, the system recalculates the affected paths those within the road’s influence radius considering the proposed enhancements.
2. **Cost Evaluation**: For each recalculated path, the solution compares the new navigational "cost" against the pre-improvement figure. A reduction in cost signifies an efficiency gain, attributed as savings to the improved road's account.
3. **Impact Analysis and Graph Update**: Roads demonstrating tangible benefits (cost savings) are flagged for updates within the urban road network graph, reflecting their improved status for subsequent analysis cycles.

### Calculating Path "Costs"

At the heart of our cost evaluation lies the Dijkstra algorithm, renowned for its efficacy in pinpointing the shortest path between two points within a graph. This algorithm is specially tailored for our analysis by limiting its scope to roads within a path's visibility range, ensuring a focused and efficient computation. The cost function employed is as follows:
```
Cost = alpha * distance + (alpha - 1) * danger
```
Here, `alpha` represents a weighting factor unique to each path, mirroring the varying priorities cyclists place on road improvements be it in terms of safety, convenience, or speed. This nuanced approach allows for a highly personalized and accurate assessment of potential improvements.
